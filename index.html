                    What inspires Malwande

                    I'm inspired by people who are into art. When I'm talking about people who are into art I'm talking about beat makers, writters, painters
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    People who can take what is in their mind and put it to the real world and make it alive. When I'm listening to a song I pay more attention to the beat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How that beat sounds and the creativity behind it inspires me to look within my mind and take what is there and put it into a website, just like how the beat maker took what was in his mind and made it alive in the real world by turning it into a sound.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    It all starts in my head as a thought then i put it in display. That's what I love about being an artist (web developer).

                    I'm not really into movies so there is no movie that would mention and say i'ts my favorite
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm more into reality shows or documentaries about topics I find interesting
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then I'm also into animation. If you catch me watching something that is not a reality show i'ts most likely to be animation
